How to build the run-time environment in the OS of Windows.

Please install the python-2.7.6.msi in the folder of python library at first.

The next step is unzip the pip.zip, and then run the get-pip.py with python.

After we have the pip tool, we can install the libraries of Warc and Whoosh.

Unzip warc-clueweb-clueweb09.zip and Whoosh-2.5.7.zip, and then run the setup.py with python for each other.

After we build the environment in success, we can run the gui.py to start our homework program.
